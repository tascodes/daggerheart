These are your Prayer Dice. You can spend any number of Prayer Dice to aid yourself or an ally within Far range. You can use a spent die’s value to reduce incoming damage, add to a roll’s result after the roll is made, or gain Hope equal to the result. At the end of each session, clear all unspent Prayer Dice.</p>",
