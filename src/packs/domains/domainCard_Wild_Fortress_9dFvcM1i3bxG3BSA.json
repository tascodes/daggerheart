On a success, <strong>spend 2 Hope</strong> to grow a natural barricade in the shape of a dome that you and one ally can take cover within. While inside the dome, a creature can’t be targeted by attacks and can’t make attacks. Attacks made against the dome automatically succeed. The dome has a Major damage threshold of 15 and a Severe damage threshold of 30, and lasts until it marks 3 Hit Points. Place tokens on this card to represent marking Hit Points.</p>",
