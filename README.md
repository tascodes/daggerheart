1. **(Not Yet Supported - No Releases Yet)** Pasting `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Foundryborne/daggerheart/refs/heads/main/system.json` into the Install System dialog on the Setup menu of the application.
2. **(Not Yet Supported - No Releases Yet)** Browsing the repository's Releases page, where you can copy any system.json link for use in the Install System dialog.
3. **(Not Yet Supported - No Releases Yet)** Downloading one of the .zip archives from the Releases page and extracting it into your foundry Data folder, under Data/systems/daggerheart.

## Development Setup

- Open a terminal in the directory with the repo `cd <path>/<to>/<repo>`
- NOTE: The repo should be placed in the system files are or somewhere else and a link (if on linux) is placed in the system directory
- NOTE: Linux link can be made using `ln -snf <path to development folder> daggerheart` inside the system folder
- Install npm `npm install`
- Update package.json to match your profile

```
"start": "concurrently \"rollup -c --watch\" \"node C:/FoundryDev/resources/app/main.js --dataPath=C:/FoundryDevFiles  --noupnp\"  \"gulp\"",
"start-test": "node C:/FoundryDev/resources/app/main.js --dataPath=C:/FoundryDevFiles && rollup -c --watch && gulp",

```

- Replace `C:/FoundryDev/resources/app/main.js` with `<your>/<path>/<to>/<foundry>/<main.js>`
- The main is likely in `<Foundry Install Location>/resouces/app/main.js`
- Replace `--dataPath=C:/FoundryDevFiles` with `<your>/<path>/<to>/<foundry>/<data>`

Now you should be able to build the app using `npm start`
